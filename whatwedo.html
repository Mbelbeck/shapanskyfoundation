            <h5 class="card-title">Sophia</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> Sitting in Sophia Bortei’s office atop her large warehouse filled with enough chairs, tables, and canopies to supply several large events, it’s hard to believe that just three years ago, she knew nothing about the event planning business. After working with her husband running a transport business, Sophia was looking for something that she could do on her own and that she was passionate about. Seeing a need for an event rentals business in her area, she set out to find out all she could, enlisting the help of other more experienced entrepreneurs to help guide her. Soon she was providing clients with full service event planning for weddings and funerals, or “the big crying events,” as she calls them. Three years later, her event rentals business is thriving and growing, thanks in part to the financing and coaching provided by the VisionFund Ghana SGB loan product. She feels that she is building more than just a business; she is building a legacy for her children. When asked what she thought made her successful in her business, “It’s the dedication,” she answered quickly. “I just love what I’m doing. You know, if you are working and you don’t have the passion for the work, it can never stand.” </p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Ethel</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The business world met Ethel at the age of 26, when her mother and her aunt decided to start a restaurant at home and she became an important element of the project. By that time, Ethel was already married and had 2 girls Karla and Cindy of 5 and 1 years old. Karla needed extra attention and health care since she was born with a disability. At age 42, Ethel went through a difficult patch, she and her husband decided to separate and the family restaurant was closed since the women decided to give a try to a new business line that promised to be more profitable: dry goods wholesale. At the end it was still food, but the women would have more time for themselves, and the goods would have a larger timespan. With this change, Ethel also became the leader of the business. Mom and aunt were already older, the strength and energy had been left as extra ingredients in all the dishes they prepared, but all the knowledge and spirit had nurtured Ethel and she was ready to run the store. Ethel was suddenly in an establishment at the marketplace. “The difficulty now, is that the prices variate along the year according to the dollar, but we know what goods are better for each season.” And the female domain expands as Ethel offers a full time job to 2 other women and 2 more temporary jobs during December. With a shy smile, Ethel reveals her goals: to sell to other larger stores and to finish the second floor at home. She wants to become for her girls and for her 3 grand children a great example of hard work and perseverance just as her mother and aunt are for her. She might not know, but she already is a great example for many women.

            <h5 class="card-title">Laura</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Laura started working when she was 19 years old, the same age she gave birth to her only child. “Looking at my baby girl changed my life, I wanted a different future for her.” And so, she started a career as a waitress, an activity with which she fall in love since she had the opportunity to talk to lots of people, to have fun and to get good tips just by being herself: lively, kind and with a big smile. Yet, she knew she did not want this to be her job for a long time, she did not want to feel stuck. Chinese, Italian, Spanish and Mexican restaurants are in Laura’s history as a waitress, and she had the chance not only to taste different cultures, but to closely analyze advantages and disadvantages of each business. At age 28, she met her current business partner. “It’s really helpful to get along with entrepreneurs.” She was caught by the same spirit and she started her own business selling jewelry but she could not dismiss her knowledge in the service sector and 4 years later she decided to start her own restaurant. “I already knew which ingredients get spoiled faster, which type of food requires more preparation time so I chose Pozole, and well, it’s my favourite too.” Recently, Laura opened the second branch of the Pozole Restaurante and she is targeting to have a chain to serve different municipalities and to have a recognized brand. She totally understands that she needs time, patience and effort to get there, but she is willing to work the extra hours and on holidays just to set the pace to her 13 employees. “I don’t like people making excuses not to work or not to get ahead.” Now, after 4 years of being in front of the restaurant, Laura has an astonishing confidence in herself and her entrepreneurial vision is easy to see.

                <h5 class="card-title">Kemali</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Kemali’s company bakes and seasons delicious snack/bites for Sri Lanka’s people. When we entered into a relationship with Kemali, she was still paying off bad debt from another loan company. At that time, she also had only one customer, another snack/bites wholesaler within the region. Through word of mouth from one of her customers, another large wholesaler and distributor was interested in purchasing product from her small manufacturing business. At first, Kemali was intimidated by the customer’s size and reputation, and considered not selling to this potential new customer. She was afraid she couldn’t trust them to pay on credit, and that she couldn’t keep up with their orders. When Kemali’s loan officer heard about this new opportunity, he worked closely with her to offer support. The loan officer ran due diligence on the customer – identifying what their needs would be, and looking into their payment credibility by talking to other customers. The loan officer also worked with Kemali on maintaining the quality of her company’s product (taste, but also delivery), while ensuring they could scale up operations to meet this client’s need. Now, Kemali is selling two tons of snacks each month to one of her country’s best-known food distributors. Kemali is excited that she now has a clear business plan – and the help of an organization that guides her growth through solid coaching and strong mentorship.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Dhalia</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Among sewing machines, large rolls of fabric in vivid colours, threads in the floor and her 11 employees working devotedly, Dalila recalls calmly the most difficult times in her business: divorce, depression and over indebtedness. “Bad decisions led me there”. But that big bump is far in the road and she prefers to talk about the bright side. Dalila started making dresses and jackets when she was 14, her sister taught her the basics of sewing and she improved her ability by working in factories, where she also learnt that she did not like buttons, eyelets and spending half the time ironing the clothing. “Besides, I like sensuality”, so the obvious was to focus in bathing suits. Today, after 20 years in her own business, Dalila’s designs are bought in Mexico City, 2 other states of the country, EE.UU,. and Belize, in total she has 10 wholesale clients. The SGB loan she received helped her to buy more rolls of fabric, clothes lining and other materials needed to get closer to her goals:  to expand the workshop and to have her own brand. Like a good business woman, she likes to know about her competitors but more than anything to listen to her clients, to think like her clients. “Every time I go to the beach, I pay attention I look at the women around and what they are using. I want my clients to look great, to feel comfortable to feel confident.” Dalila knows there are probably going to be more difficult times, but she knows she can get ahead with perseverance, enthusiasm and passion, reflecting her love for what she does in every piece that comes out from her workshop.</p>
